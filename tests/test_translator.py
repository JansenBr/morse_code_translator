        To be, or not to be, that is the question:
        Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub:
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause—there’s the respect
